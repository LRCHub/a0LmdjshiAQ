What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am
Here you come knocking on my door
When you said you don't need me anymore
Now do you really think I'm crazy enough
To go throwing my good heart after bad love

Chorus
What kind of fool do you think I am
I ain't fallin for you all over again
I ain't playin a game that I know I can't win
What kind of fool do you think I am
Oh, what kind of fool do you think I am

I was lost in your love and I got burned
You hurt me one time, I finally learned
Now that I know what your lovin can do
Who do you think you're talkin to

Repeat Chorus

Fallin in love with you just brought me sorrow
You'll leave me smilin tonight and cryin tomorrow

Don't you come knocking on my door
'Cause you know I don't need you anymore
Now do you really think I'm crazy enough
To go throwin my good heart after bad love

Repeat Chorus Twice
